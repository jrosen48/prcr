Description: Provides an easy-to-use yet adaptable set of tools to conduct person-center analysis using a two-step clustering procedure and Gaussian mixture modeling.
    As described in Bergman and El-Khouri (1999) <DOI:10.1002/(SICI)1521-4036(199910)41:6%3C753::AID-BIMJ753%3E3.0.CO;2-K>, hierarchical clustering is performed to
    determine the initial partition for the subsequent k-means clustering procedure. Provides functionality in terms of how the residual covariance matrix of the clustered
    variables is structured familiar to those who use Latent Profile Analysis. Follows a tidy philosophy, in that output is in the form of a tibble (a data.frame) that can
    subsequently be computed on.
