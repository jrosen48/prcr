Description: The prcr package provides an easy-to-use yet adaptable set of tools to conduct person-center analysis using cluster analysis. While person-centered analysis is increasingly common in psychology, education, and related fields, carrying it out is challenging. This package uses hierarchical and k-means clustering algorithms to create the profiles. It outputs summaries of the data (including a ggplot2 plot) and the raw data for use in subsequent analyses.
