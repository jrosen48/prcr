Description: The prcr package provides an easy-to-use yet adaptable set of tools to conduct person-center analysis using a two-step (hierarchical and iterative) cluster analysis as described in Bergman & El-Khouri (1999) <10.1002/(SICI)1521-4036(199910)41:6<753::AID-BIMJ753>3.0.CO;2-K>. While person-centered analysis is increasingly common in psychology, education, and related fields, carrying it out is challenging.
