# prcr

`prcr` is an `R` package for person-centered analysis. Person-centered analyses focus on clusters, or profiles, of observations, and their change over time or differences across factors. See [Bergman and El-Khouri (1999)](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/(SICI)1521-4036(199910)41:6%3C753::AID-BIMJ753%3E3.0.CO;2-K/abstract) for a description of the analytic approach. See [Corpus and Wormington (2014)](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00220973.2013.876225) for an example of person-centered analysis in psychology and education.

## Installation

You can install the development version `prcr` from Github with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")

```

You can install `prcr` from CRAN with:

```{r, eval = F}

## Example

This is a basic example using the built-in dataset `pisaUSA15`:

```{r, eval = F}
library(prcr)
```

```{r example}
df <- pisaUSA15
m3 <- create_profiles_cluster(df, broad_interest, enjoyment, instrumental_mot, self_efficacy, n_profiles = 3)
summary(m3)
```
